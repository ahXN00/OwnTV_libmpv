# Builds this repo's libmpv on the owner's PC, in WSL, and drops it into a local Maven folder that
# core and both apps read for a build run with -Powntv.libmpvLocalRepo=E:/Linux/Libmpv/maven (see core's
# CLAUDE.md, "Testing an mpv engine change before it is released"). Nothing is published; CI stays the only way to a
# release.
#
# Once per WSL install (as root — installs the same packages as .github/workflows/build.yaml):
#   wsl -d Debian -u root -- bash /mnt/e/MEGA/CODE/AI/OwnTV_Suite/OwnTV_libmpv/buildscripts/wsl_build.sh
# Every build (as the normal user):
#   wsl -d Debian -- bash /mnt/e/MEGA/CODE/AI/OwnTV_Suite/OwnTV_libmpv/buildscripts/wsl_build.sh
#
# The build runs in $WORK, inside the distro's own disk (E:\Linux\Libmpv\ext4.vhdx): building on
# /mnt/e is many times slower and would put gigabytes into the MEGA folder. The repo is copied
# there on every run, so the build always uses the files as they are on E: right now, uncommitted
# edits included. The first run downloads the SDK, NDK and every source (~1 h in total); after
# that only changed pins are downloaded again.

# Run as `bash wsl_build.sh`, the -e on the first line is ignored — so set it here.
